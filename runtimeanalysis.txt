Insert is an raised to the second power or has an exponent of 2 algorithm because it must touch every element in the pre-existing array and 
shift it down a spot before it puts a new element at the beginning. However, Append is a worst case O(n) algorithm, but average case of constant time.Append scales much better
 in time performance and  it's easy to tell based on the big O of the algorithms, and the collected data.
